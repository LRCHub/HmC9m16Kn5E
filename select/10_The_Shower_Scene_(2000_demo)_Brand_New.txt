It's funny how your worst enemies always seem to
Turn out to be all of your best friend's best friends
But I folded and I told
These are the things I saved to sink you
But I fold, I told
So draw or throw and I will explode

It's time for you to choose the bullet or the chapstick
"Oh, you are far too cute" or whatever he said

Every time I hear it I am wishing I was great I wished her
Past tense, my best friend
But I folded and I told
These aren't things I say to save me
But I folded, I told
I hope she's caught in the explosion

It's time for you to choose the bullet or the chapstick
"Oh, you are far too cute" or whatever he said
It's time for you to choose
The bullet or the chapstick
This is me in his room X...

Red, gold, I told
We don't play fair
Red, gold, I told
We never stand too close

So I update this almost every single day for you
I begin to hate you for your face and not just the things you do
Go tell him how my wrist is sore from pulling at your insides all night
Nothing that you do is new to anything or anyone but you
