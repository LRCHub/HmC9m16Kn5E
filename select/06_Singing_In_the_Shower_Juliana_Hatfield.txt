Morning has come
Much too soon
He puts on his tie
And thinks of you

Singing in the shower
Dreaming of nights he's been missing
All of his life

Singing in the shower
No one can hear
He's been no one for forty years
He wanted to live like a rolling stone
With a beautiful wife
And city and country homes

Singing in the shower
He's off tonight
He's been no one all of his life
Singing in the shower
No one can hear
He's been waiting for forty years

Tears in his eyes
Washing away
Singing in the shower
No one can hear
He's been waiting for forty years
Singing in the shower
Got no stage fright
He's been practicing all of his life
