Singing in the shower
I am singing my heart out for the one I love

I really love you
I truly do
I really love you
I'm a fool

Singing in the shower
I am singing my heart out for the one I love

Why, why why why?
Why oh why? Why oh why?
Why, why why why?
Why oh why? Why oh why?

Why must I suffer the way I do?
Why is my love for only you?

Singing in the shower
I am singing my heart out for the one I love
I am singing my heart out for the one I love
